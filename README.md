# Robo-Potato-Cat
Project for our PSC Capstone course.
In this project we will be creating a program to simulate a JD EZ Robot. We will be creating a tutorial for users to utilise our software, as well as (maybe) the ability to control an actual robot with our simulator. We may have time to add a JD skin to the simulation.
