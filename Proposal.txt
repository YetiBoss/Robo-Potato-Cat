Assuming robo-potato-cat uses the following steps to complete our task...

	1) Download SCS and run one of the example tutorials 
	2) Make a simple one joint robot (maybe a pendulum) 
	3) Make a controller for that robot (maybe hold the pendulum inverted) 
	4) Make a multi-joint robot (maybe a two joint robot arm) 
	5) Make a controller for that 
	6) Make a JD robot 
	7) Make a controller for that
		a) stand in place 
		b) move arms 
		c) change height (squat) 
		d) basic walk 
	8) Skin the robot to look like JD

our proposal is to complete the above steps within the following schedule...

	1) completed by 1/30
	2) completed by 2/6
	3) by 2/13
	4) by 2/27
	5) 3/13
	6) 3/27
	7) 4/10
	8) 4/24
	
Steps 7-a, -b, -c, -d will be completed separately by individual members of the team. Memeber assignments for each controller to be announced.
